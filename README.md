# CNetBoVW-Using-Convolutional-Features-to-Aid-Management-at-Geographical-Scene-Classification-
With the popular use of geotagging images, more and more research efforts have been placed on geographical scene classification. In geographical scene classification, effective spatial feature selection can significantly boost the final performance. Bag of visual words (BoVW) can be used for spatial feature selection in geographical scene classification, nevertheless, this works well only if the feature extractor is well provided. In this paper, we use convolutional neural networks (CNN) for optimizing proposed feature extractor, so that it can learn more suitable visual vocabularies from the geotagging images.
